        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm an early career environmental scientist with a focus on GIS. I received my Bachelor's of Science from USF with 2 minors, GIS and Spanish. I have 2 years of experience with ArcGIS Pro, and enjoy creating maps about local environmental issues, which you can see here: https://spatialnode.net/bridgethart My goal is to work in environmental consulting and assist in implementation of and compliance with sustainable policies, design, and resource management. Eventually I wish to work in resource management and sustainability, leveraging my environmental experience with my passion for education to improve understanding of environmental processes to adults and youth. I'm proficient in Spanish and have successfully taught English to Spanish speakers at a community library program and as well as traveled in Spanish speaking countries. I'm passionate about education on all levels, and tutor in my free time.</p>
